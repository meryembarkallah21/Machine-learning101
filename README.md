# Machine Learning Practice Notebooks 🤖

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing various machine learning practice notebooks! 📚 These notebooks were created as part of small practical exercises during my school courses. Each notebook focuses on a different topic and covers different aspects of machine learning and data science. Here's a brief overview of the notebooks in this repository:

## List of Notebooks 📋

- **machinelearning_ds.ipynb**: This notebook covers loading and exploring datasets, data preprocessing, and building machine learning models using various algorithms. It includes topics like decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and more.

- **tp5_TP_ML_keras.ipynb**: In this notebook, I delve into deep learning using Keras. It includes a practical implementation of a neural network for image classification using the MNIST dataset.

- **tp4_kmeans.ipynb**: This notebook explores the K-Means clustering algorithm. It includes an example of image segmentation using K-Means clustering.

- **TP_Regression_final.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on regression techniques in machine learning. It covers linear regression and showcases how to evaluate regression models.

- **Tp2_ML.ipynb**: In this notebook, I explore various preprocessing techniques and apply machine learning algorithms for classification tasks.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with these notebooks, you can simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-practice.git
```

Make sure you have the required libraries installed by creating a virtual environment and installing the dependencies:

```bash
cd machine-learning-practice
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can open and run the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
